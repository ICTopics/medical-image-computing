Hey, my name is Jack 👋. I am a first year computing undergraduate 🖥 at Imperial College London. My favourite area of computing is databases. Before studying at Imperial 🎓, I studied at The Billericay School and Westcliff High School for Boys Sixth Form 🏫. I enjoy playing the piano 🎹, especially jazz 🎺 and classical music 🎶.

I first realised I wanted to study computing when my A Level maths teacher 👨‍🏫 started discussing computer-assisted proofs, and why some people didn't accept their validity. I was extremely intrigued 🤔, and so decided to complete my Extended Project 📄 on it. Since then, I have realised that computer science is a much wider area than just writing programs, and that is why I want to learn more about it 👨‍🎓.

In my free time, I enjoy listening to a wide variety of music, especially pop 🎧. When I'm not working, I enjoy spending time with my friends all over the country 🗺. I also love to travel ✈️ - my favourite experiences are surfing 🏄‍ in *Santa Barbara, California*, visiting museums 🏛 in *Washington DC*, visiting the Colosseum 🇮🇹 in *Rome, Italy*, driving a Jeep across sand dunes 🇴🇲 in *Oman*, and visiting the world's tallest building 🏗 in *Dubai, United Arab Emirates*.
