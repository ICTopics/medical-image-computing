Hey, my name is Jack 👋. I am a first year computing undergraduate 🖥 at Imperial College London. My favourite area of computing is databases. Before studying at Imperial 🎓, I studied at The Billericay School and Westcliff High School for Boys Sixth Form 🏫. I enjoy playing the piano 🎹, especially jazz 🎺 and classical music 🎶.
