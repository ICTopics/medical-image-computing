Hi all! My name is Julie, and I am a French student reading Computing at Imperial. One of the topics I've particularly enjoyed looking into so far is Machine Learning, and more specifically its applications in fields I might not have considered before, such as Medical Imaging. 

My free time is mainly spent making the most out of life in London. From concerts to food festivals, I always find new plans to make, even after having lived here during my whole life! Aside from this, staying active is amongst my main hobbies. Whilst I love surfing, London isn't exactly ideal for such a sport, so basketball is currently my main activity. Having played as captain at my previous school, I enjoy regularly helping out the new team during trainings.
