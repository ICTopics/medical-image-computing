Hi all! My name is Julie, and I am a French student reading Computing at Imperial. Back in the days when I was unfamiliar with "Null Pointer Exceptions", what initially sparked my interest in this field was discovering how IBM's Watson was being used in the Wimbledon Tennis Championships. How this computer system could understand a visitor's queries whilst providing live match analysis fascinated me. To this day, Machine Learning remains one of my main areas of interest. I've particularly enjoyed looking into its applications in fields I hadn't considered before, such as Medical Imaging. 

My free time is mainly spent making the most out of life in London. From concerts to food festivals, I always find new plans to make - even after having lived here during my whole life! Aside from this, staying active is amongst my other hobbies. Whilst I love surfing, London isn't exactly ideal for such a sport, so basketball is currently my main activity . Having played as captain at my previous school, I enjoy regularly helping out the new team during trainings.
