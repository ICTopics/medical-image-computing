Hello. My name is Hashan. I am a first-year undergraduate at Imperial College London, studying Computing. I am the most awesome person ever (proof is trivial, left as an exercise for the reader). Before Imperial, I studied at Westcliff High School for Boys for 7 years.

I started being interested in computers from a very young age. More specifically, it was software that I was fascinated by. I believed that the meteoritic rise of software to prominence in society, would only continue and was an inevitable and welcome step in the progress of humankind. I very much shared the mentality of Marc Andreessen's 2011 article, *Why Software Is Eating The World*. For me, it was software, not the computer per se that was at the foundation of the computer revolution. Because, in the end hardware on its own, is useless. The value was in the software, which could be written once, and executed everywhere and forever, at least that's the theory. Writing software was, in theory, one of the best investements that could be made. As once produced, it could be run again and again, where the marginal cost was only the cost of the hardware, which was usually an inexpensive cost anyway, thanks to Moore's law, which at least then was true.

Though, I had grand predictions of what software would be able to accomplish, in many ways I think I under-estimated how much software is changing society. Software has begun to disrupt every industry. Technology companies are challenging every vertical. Consider firms such as Tesla, Waymo and Uber, against the traditional transportation companies, companies such as Netflix against the traditional television giants, and Amazon against the supermarket industry. One of my favourite quotes is that of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos:

> Your margin is my opportunity. <small>Jeff Bezos</small>

Over the last couple of the years, technology companies have begun to get a bad reputation, and in many cases this reputation is well-deserved. From driving up house prices in San Francisco, to "fake news", to Susan Fowler's horrifying account of mistreatment at Uber, controversy at the bitcoin bubble, technology is getting a bad reputation in the media. But I remain optimistic that in the long run, software will push society in a positive direction. 

The areas of Computing I am most interested are formal verification and machine learning. The reason that I'm interested in formal verification, is that I think there is a lack of emphasis on correctness and reliability in today's software development industry. As I said, technology companies are getting a bad reputation, and this isn't helped by countless stories of software and, in some cases, hardware bugs. I, therefore, find my interest in formal verification, a natural progression in my concern for the influence of software on society.

As I said I am also fascinated by machine learning. Following from what I said above, I think one of the best opportunities for software to improve society is through machine learning. One the most direct improvements that can happen is in medicine, and it is something I am deeply excited about. But I am also intrigued by the theoretical aspects of machine learning. I am amazed at how accurately, machine learning algorithms allow computers to attain better-than-human performance in tasks such as image recognition, through learning a hidden representation of data. This is all done independently of understanding what the data actually means.

Aside from my interest in Computing, I am an avid watcher of television. My favourite TV shows of all time are *Game of Thrones*, *Friends*, *Stranger Things*, *Mr Robot*, *IT Crowd*, *Freaks and Geeks* and *The Handmaid's Tale*. One of the things I've always wanted to do, with nothing to do with my interest in Computing, is to write my own script for a television show, specifically a comedy-drama I've had in mind for a while, with a somewhat similar premise to *Freaks and Geeks*.

I also like reading. My favourite fiction book is Jane Austen's *Pride and Prejudice* and my favourite non-fiction books are Walter Isaacson's biography of Steve Jobs and Susan Cain's *Quiet*. But my favourite fictional character is Severus Snape in J. K. Rowling's *Harry Potter*.

Here are some other quotes I like:

> I choose a lazy person to do a hard job. Because a lazy person will find an easy way to do it. <small>Bill Gates</small>

> The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do. <small>Steve Jobs</small>
