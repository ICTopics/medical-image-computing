Hello. My name is Hashan. I am a first-year undergraduate at Imperial College London, studying Computing. I am the most awesome person ever (proof is trivial, left as an exercise for the reader). Before Imperial, I studied at Westcliff High School for Boys for 7 years.

I started being interested in computers from a very young age. More specifically, it was software that I was fascinated by. I believed that the meteoritic rise of software to prominence in society, would only continue and was an inevitable and welcome step in the progress of humankind. I very much shared the mentality of Marc Andreessen's 2011 article, *Why Software Is Eating The World*. For me, it was software, not the computer per se that was at the foundation of the computer revolution. Because, in the end hardware on its own, is useless. The value was in the software, which could be written once, and executed everywhere and forever, at least that's the theory.

The areas of Computing I am most interested are formal verification and machine learning. The reason that I'm interested in formal verification, is that I think there is a lack of emphasis on correctness and reliability in today's software development industry. This is evidenced by countless stories of software and, in some cases, hardware bugs.

As I said I am also fascinated by machine learning. Following from what I said above, I think one of the best opportunities for software to improve society is through machine learning. One the most direct improvements that can happen is in medicine, and it is something I am deeply excited about. But I am also intrigued by the theoretical aspects of machine learning. I am amazed at how accurately, machine learning algorithms allow computers to attain better-than-human performance in tasks such as image recognition, through learning a hidden representation of data.

Aside from my interest in Computing, I am an avid watcher of television. My favourite TV shows of all time are *Game of Thrones*, *Friends*, *Stranger Things*, *Mr Robot*, *IT Crowd*, *Freaks and Geeks* and *The Handmaid's Tale*.
