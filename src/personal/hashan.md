Hello. My name is Hashan. I am a first-year undergraduate at Imperial College London, studying Computing. I am the most awesome person ever (proof is trivial, left as an exercise for the reader). The areas of Computing I am most interested are formal verification and machine learning. Before Imperial, I studied at Westcliff High School for Boys for 7 years. Aside from my interest in Computing, I am an avid watcher of television. My favourite TV shows of all time are *Game of Thrones*, *Friends*, *Stranger Things*, *Mr Robot*, *IT Crowd*, *Freaks and Geeks* and *The Handmaid's Tale*. Here are some quotes I like:

> I choose a lazy person to do a hard job. Because a lazy person will find an easy way to do it. <small>Bill Gates</small>

> The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do. <small>Steve Jobs</small>
