Hi, I'm Hugo. I'm a first year undergraduate computing student at Imperial College London. My main interests in Computing are in Data Science and Machine Learning, particularly in how it can it be applied to social and environmental issues.
Outside of computing, I enjoy gaming and musical theatre, with some of my favourite shows being *Ghost*, *Jesus Christ Superstar* and *The Greatest Showman*. I also like to cook and so I made a web app called foodmatching which aims to generate recipes based on what you have in your fridge!
