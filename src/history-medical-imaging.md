# History of Medical Imaging
## Introduction to Medical Imaging
The origin of medical images is around the start of the 20th century, after the discovery of the x-ray. This started a growing interest in radiology, but it took off during the Second World War.
Medical imaging initially started with x-rays which would be passed through the body onto some film, which would generate an image. They could take up to 11 minutes, and would subject the patient to 50 times more radiation that an x-ray today, which takes just milliseconds.
There were lots of improvements to this initial technique over the first half of the 20th century, but in the 1960s came ultrasound scanning. The development of sonar during World War II allowed his to become a reality, - it works by sending a stream of high frequency, low wavelength sound waves to penetrate through the body to hit the organs inside, bouncing back to the detector. This can be used to generate an image under the skin, and also does not subject the body to harmful x-rays, and so is used in pregnant women.
Another big step was in the 1970s, when digital imaging techniques, such as the computed tomography scanner, more commonly known as the CT scanner, became widely available. This change to digital techniques had many benefits, including:
  
  - smaller x-ray doses
  - ability to enhance images with technology
  - ease of storing records
  - ability to use computers to analyse images and detect issues.

After these new imaging techniques became more common, doctors realised that they needed ways of analysing these images in order to get the maximum use from them. This lead to people discovering new methods of medical image analysis. 

## History of Medical Image Analysis
It was in the 1960s that computer-based image analysis started to appear, meaning that it has been around for nearly 60 years. However, there have been many advances since they were first introduced, especially with the introduction of digitalisation in the 1970s.
Medical images are not simple to understand, as they contain a lot of information, and therefore the idea of using computers to analyse them became apparent. There are many types of medical image, for example CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to more cutting edge types such as optical coherence tomography and magnetoencephalography (MEG).

There are many reasons that medical image analysis is needed:
 
  - Clinical study - image analysis is used here in order to detect patterns between multiple images, which may support or confirm hypotheses of the study. As the images are digital, they can all be collated i one place, no matter where in the world they are taken, and can be analysed here. The results can also be stores here, which allows for much larger, globally-spanning clinical studies.
  - Diagnosis support - this combines computer-aided detection and diagnosis. Artificial intelligence can be used to detect patterns in images, and doctors can review the results of this when diagnosing patients. They can then input their final diagnosis into the system, and the AI can learn how accurate it's diagnosis was. 
  - Treatment planning - this is used before treatment is given to a patient. Application of this are in surgery and radiology, allowing doctors to be given information on the best course of treatment for a patient, based on previous patient outcomes. 
  - Computer-assisted surgery - this newly-emerging field allows computers to diagnose and treat the patient. It allows images to be taken, analysed, and the appropriate response taken in much less time than it would take a human doctor.
