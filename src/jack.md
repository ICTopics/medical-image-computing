Hello. My name is Jack. I am a first year computing undergraduate at Imperial College London. My favourite area of computing is prodedural programming. Before studying at Imperial, I studied at The Billericay School and Westcliff High School for Boys Sixth Form.

## Personal Statement

It is evident that Computer Science is at the forefront of the rapidly developing world, and I want to be part of this field. Due to the ever-changing nature of the technological world, it is not enough to just know 'how to code'; people need to be able to understand the fundamental concepts of programming, and this is why I want to study the subject further.
I am currently enjoying studying A Level Computer Science, which has given me a solid foundation of computational concepts and experience with a wide variety of programming languages. I have deepened this knowledge with further reading, including 'Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software' by Charles Petzold. This book, which discusses the fundamentals of computing, while gradually building on how computers work from first principles, sparked my interest in the theoretical side of Computer Science. This is why I am completing an Extended Project in this area, entitled 'To What Extent Should Computer-Assisted Proofs be Trusted as a Valid Method of Proving a Mathematical Problem's Solution?'. I find problem solving interesting, especially since successfully completing many Project Euler tasks, which are challenging mathematical problems solved using programming.
I have attended many lectures on topics such as photonics, nebulae and number theory, and a computing lecture on Russian Peasant Multiplication and its uses in Computer Science. These lectures inspired me to investigate topics further, especially the computing lecture, which was a contributing factor to my EPQ choice. I enjoy expanding my knowledge, which is furthered by my creation of computing projects such as a website used by a commercial business, and an iOS application for my A Level coursework. 
Furthermore, I am a member of both the Engineering and Algorithms Societies in my Sixth Form, attending weekly lectures for both, where we discuss a range of current topics related to engineering or programming. One example is Object-Oriented Programming, which after further research I implemented into my coursework as I liked that inheritance allowed me to minimise duplicate code.
I enjoy problem solving, and in 2015 I participated in two computational thinking challenges; the British Informatics Olympiad and the Elite Bebras Challenge. I've also achieved gold certificates in multiple UKMT Mathematics Challenges, and best in my school year for the Intermediate Challenge.
Earlier this year, I took part in a Cambridge University Shadowing Scheme, run by the CUSU, for three days. This experience involved attending the lectures of a maths student, while also engaging in many other activities and interacting with students and lecturers. This immersion in university life was very enjoyable, and speaking to computing students confirmed my view that I would like studying the subject further.
I have had many positions of responsibility, including House Captain, Prefect and Subject Mentor. Some responsibilities include leading assemblies to over 300 students and teachers, mentoring a GCSE student for maths, and also working with a group of students in Year 9 who want to extend their mathematical knowledge. Furthermore, I assist a class of computing students every week, improving my leadership skills, as well as developing my team working skills through my Duke of Edinburgh Bronze Award. While volunteering in the fundraising department of a local hospice for this, I organised various events and liaised with other charities, improving my communication skills.
I was elected as a member of the Billericay Youth Town Council in 2014, and have attended bi-weekly meetings since then. In addition, I enjoyed working at a children's play centre, and have taken piano exams up to Grade 4, which I successfully balance alongside my studies. I plan to continue to expand my work and study of computing, becoming a software developer, where I can continue to learn new skills in this dynamic field.
