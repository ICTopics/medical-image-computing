# Types of Medical Imaging

There are many different types of medical imaging techniques, which use different technologies to produce images for different purposes. This page will give an introduction to the most common imaging techniques, and the page on uses of AI in radiology will show how some of these techniques, combined with AI, will pave the way for more accurate imaging.

## CT Scanners

### What is a CT Scanner?

A computerised tomography scan, more commonly called a CT scan, can create a detailed image of the inside of the body using x-rays and computers. It is different to an x-ray because it produced a cross-sectional image of the body, similar to an MRI, making them better at looking at soft tissue and more subtle parts of the image that an x-ray may not pick up.

### What do they produce images of?

They can be used to visualise bones, internal organs and blood vessels. Upper body, such as the brain, neck, spine, chest and sinuses are commonly scanned.

### What are some common uses?

They are frequently used in __diagnosis__, for example to find tumours, or to see broken bones. Another use is to find more __detail__ after another scan, such as an x-ray. __Monitoring__ is also an important use of CT scanners, as regular scans allow progress to be kept of any developing conditions, e.g. cancer.

### How does it work?

The patient lies on their back on a panel. This panel passes into the scanner, which rotates around the section of your body currently in the scanner. The patient needs to lay still so that the scan can get a clear image. Usually, the radiologist who is operating the machine stands in another room to avoid the radiation, but can communicate with the patient via an intercom. The scan can take from 10 to 20 minutes, but results are available as soon as a computer has analysed the scans.

### What are any advantages and disadvantages?

#### Advantages

- CT scans are fairly short - they only last about 10 - 20 minutes.
- The results are extremely fast compared to some other types of scans.
- CT scans are painless, as they are non-invasive.

#### Disadvantages

- As with lots of scans, your body is exposed to some radiation. The more of the patient's body that is scanned, the more radiation they are exposed to. However, they are designed to minimise radiation exposure.
- There is the possibility of an allergic reaction to the dye used.
